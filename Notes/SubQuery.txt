Subqueries in SQL
A subquery (or inner query) is a query nested inside another query (outer query). Subqueries are used to perform operations that require multiple steps or conditions that can't be handled by a single query.

Key Points:
Enclosed in parentheses ( ).
Can return a single value, a list of values, or a table.
Used in:
WHERE clause
FROM clause
SELECT clause
Subqueries are executed before the outer query.
---------------------------------
Table:
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    department_id INT,
    job_title VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, salary, department_id, job_title) VALUES
(101, 'John Smith', 60000, 10, 'Manager'),
(102, 'Alice Brown', 50000, 20, 'Developer'),
(103, 'Bob Johnson', 70000, 10, 'Manager'),
(104, 'Carol Davis', 40000, 30, 'Developer'),
(105, 'Eve Walker', 45000, 20, 'Developer');

CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    location_id INT
);
INSERT INTO departments (department_id, name, location_id) VALUES
(10, 'Sales', 1),
(20, 'IT', 2),
(30, 'HR', 3);
select * from departments;

CREATE TABLE locations (
    location_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    city VARCHAR(50)
);
INSERT INTO locations (location_id, city) VALUES
(1, 'New York'),
(2, 'London'),
(3, 'Mumbai');

select * from locations;

select * from employees;



Types of Subqueries
1.Single-Row Subquery

Returns only one row.
Commonly used with operators like =, <, >, <=, >=.

SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);



2.Multi-Row Subquery

Returns multiple rows.
Requires operators like IN, ANY, or ALL.
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location = 'New York');

3.Correlated Subquery

References columns from the outer query.
Executes once for each row in the outer query.
SELECT e.name
FROM employees e
WHERE e.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e.department_id);

4.Nested Subqueries

Subqueries inside other subqueries.
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM departments
    WHERE location_id = (SELECT location_id FROM locations WHERE city = 'London')
);
