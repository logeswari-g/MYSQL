stored procedure:

A stored procedure in MySQL is a set of SQL statements that you can save and reuse. Stored procedures allow you to execute complex logic (like loops, conditionals, and SQL queries) on the server side, improving efficiency and reusability. They are especially useful for repetitive tasks, encapsulating business logic, and managing complex transactions.
