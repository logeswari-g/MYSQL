MySQL LIMIT Clause
Definition
The LIMIT clause is used to specify the maximum number of rows to return from a query. It's useful for:

Reducing the result set.
Pagination in applications.
Performance optimization by retrieving only the required data.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT row_count OFFSET;

ExAMPLE:
SELECT * FROM Employees
LIMIT 5;
Retrieves the first 5 rows from the Employees table.


SELECT * FROM Employees
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 3;

Skips the first 3 rows and retrieves the next 5 rows.


You can also specify LIMIT and OFFSET in a single statement:

SELECT * FROM Employees
LIMIT 3, 5;
