SQL Views
Definition:
A view is a virtual table that is based on the result of an SQL query. It does not store data itself but displays data stored in other tables.

Advantages of Views:

Simplifies complex queries.
Provides data security by showing only specific columns/rows.
Makes maintenance easier by abstracting underlying table structure.

syntax:

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Example:

CREATE VIEW HighEarners AS
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 50000;


SELECT * FROM view_name;


DROP VIEW view_name;
